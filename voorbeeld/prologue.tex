\chapter{Prologue}

Dear reader,

It is now June 2010, and I'm thinking back two years ago when the idea for this study tour first saw the light of day. While having a beer Jins, Frank, Margot and I  decided that we wanted to visit Russia some time. Of course, you can go to Russia as a tourist and visit Moscow to see all the beautiful churches, the Red Square, the Kremlin, the magnificent metro and the rest of the city. In Saint Petersburg you cannot miss the Hermitage, the Nevski Prospect, eat roast potato's with garlic and dill and have a vodka.

But then you will miss out on all the other great things that you can only have in a study tour.
You will probably not sign up for a course basic Russian and we would not have met our lovely but stern teacher Tatyana, thanks to whom we could actually understand the first directions given in Russian by a stranger.
We would not have given a lecture in Russian to the participants of the tour and teach them to say \quote{\ru здравствуйте, милиционер} (good day, officer) without smiling.
We would not have fifteen physicists with us with whom you can always have a good time.
We would not have our scientific supervisor dr. Andrei Kiriliouk with us and we would have been lost many times in cities, science and menu's.

We certainly would not have seen all the (formally) closed science cities and institutes and have heard fascinating stories of our Russian hosts about the current state and history of Russian science. And we would miss the tours they gave to show their sometimes enormous machines to practice science.
We would not have taken the Trans-Siberian Express to Novosibirsk and see the beautiful Russian countryside.
And of course we would not have this extensive report written by the participants of the tour about all the science we have seen and all adventures we have had in Russia.

I'd like to thank my committee members Margot, Jins and Frank for all the great times we had together while organising this tour. Thanks also to Andrei, not only for showing us the Russian way to have a vodka, but mainly for all help and advise he gave us.

Have fun reading this report.
