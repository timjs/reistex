\report[cul:nachttrein]{The night train}{\date[d=13,m=10,y=2009]}{Sjoerd Verhagen}

Our night train from Saint Petersburg to Moscow: in Dutch it would be discribed as a \quote{denderende reis}, in English it takes a few more words.

We were informed to gather in the hostel stricktly at 20:45~\PM. Prior to this departure, I interviewed some other participants on what would be their very first long train experience.

\emph{Anything else you are hoping for?}

\subsection{Tim}

\startlines

\subsection{Jeroen}

\startlines
\emph{Have you ever made such a long journey by train?}
\quote{Nope.}
\emph{What do you like about this trip?}

\quote{I don't know how the cabins look like so I don't care as long as there is enough room for my luggage.}
\stoplines

\subsection{Jasper}

\quote{Never, unfortunately.}
\emph{Could we wake you up if a really cosy faintly lighted little town comes by during the night?}

Besides, if we sleep during traveling, our day program can contain more science, not to mention the saving of one hostelnight.}
\emph{How do you feel about getting up before 6:00\AM?}

\emph{Anything you like to let us know?}
\quote{Tomorrow I am going to be a zombie, do not talk to me, do not expect from me more than the strictly nessecary.}

\section{The nighttrain}

\placefigure[right]
  {Our train}
  {\externalfigure[train][width=0.35\textwidth]}

At 20:52~\PM\ it was time to say goodbye to our beloved Crazy Duck hostel.

In the metro, we lost Andrei and Martijn after we got out of a train. Many next trains passed but the two were not to be seen. As telephone reception is nonexistent that deep underground, radiocontact was not possible. Confident of Andrei's capabilities, and remembering the 10\

After our recon unit (Margot \& Andrei) found the correct train, we all moved into waiting position. The trains still had their communist logos in place and were a sight to see. We were informed to all stay in our cabins for the first half our to allow the organisers to hand out paperwork.

  {Training at night, no worries!}
  {\externalfigure[coupe][width=0.35\textwidth]}

Your author shared a cabin with Guus, Maarten and Jorrit, deeply unsatisfying compared to Andrei, who was allowed to spend the night with no less than three of our girls. The cabins were capable of housing all our luggage and all nessecary sleeping equipment was present. A quick survey of the train revealed Jins, Frank, Jeroen and Martijn as the most notorious drinkers, a whopping three bottles of Wodka could be found on their humble cabin table. Four of our girls, Ans, Eveline, Madelon and Inka shared a room together. It's just neccesary, Eveline explained.

Curiously the train speakers played sad music upon departing the Moskova station\footnote{Which is indeed situated in Saint Petersburg, the former Leningrad.} for our destination: Leningrada station\footnote{Which is indeed situated in Mocow.}. Departure was at 22:22~\PM\ exactly, as planned by the way. Guus notified us that he has \quote{accidently} stolen a towel from our beloved hostel, an event which would repeat itself furtheron in our Russian journey.

We managed to place everyone in a single cabin, which is a very cosy experience, if you are not claustrophobic. Here, Jonas and your author are awarded a bottle of wodka for posing the most interesting question in the recent scientific visits.

  {Claustrophobia!}
  {\externalfigure[claustrophobia][width=0.5\textwidth]}

While Jasper and Maarten proceed to play some chess and complain about the music which can't be turned off, Jonas meets up with a Russian technical student: Vova, or perhaps Wowa. He does not speak much of English but his jar of home made wodka gives us a good hint about his intentions. His mother passes our cabin and warns her son to watch out with that wodka; so much for the concealing strategy. The conversation subject is hard to elevate above girls and wodka. After we succeed in declining any more than would be lethal ammount of his wodka\footnote{Which we drank from empty tea glasses.}, we decide to call in our Russian speaking Andrei to politely ask the young man to allow us some sleep. The poor chap did not seal his jar of wodka well enough upon leaving, he accidently poured half of it in his bag. Luckily the sugarless wodka does not stick.

The train is so long the locomotive cannot be heard. Combining this relative silence with an ambient temperature of 20 degrees results in a good night's rest on the part of the author from 0:00\AM\ till 5:30\AM. At least that was what we planned. Half an hour of time to get ready for leaving the train was not enough in the eyes of our provodnika. At 5:00\AM\ she came to our doors to protrude Martijns dream of a black man with salmon. Fortunately a collective quick``da" from our beds made her leave. Waking up was harsh, buying sweet `empire` tea from the conductor eased our pains.

Only one minute late, at 6:03\AM\ we arrive at Leningrada station, Moscow.

A quick survey among my fellow travellers afterwards tells a train of equal flamboyance for the transsiberia trip would be satisfying.
