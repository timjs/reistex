\section{General}

This is the report of our study tour to Russia which took place in October 2009. The tour was organised by the students' association for physics and astronomy, Marie Curie, of the Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
All contributions to this report are by the participants of the tour. The organising committee, however, has made some slight modifications here and there. Still, responsibility for the contents of this report lies completely with the authors of the individual chapters.
